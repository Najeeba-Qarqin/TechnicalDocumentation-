        <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
        <h2>Try React</h2>
        <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.
        </p>
        <h2>Learn React</h2>
        <p>People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful
          If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our practical tutorial.
          If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our guide to main concepts.
          Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it.
        </p>
        <h2>Staying Informed</h2>
        <p>The React blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted there first.
          You can also follow the @reactjs account on Twitter, but you won’t miss anything essential if you only read the blog.
          Not every React release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release in the CHANGELOG.md file in the React repository, as well as on the Releases page.
        </p>
        <h2>Versioned Documentation</h2>
        <p>This documentation always reflects the latest stable version of React. Since React 16, you can find older versions of the documentation on a separate page. Note that documentation for past versions is snapshotted at the time of the release, and isn’t being continuously updated.
