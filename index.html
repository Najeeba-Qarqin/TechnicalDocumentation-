        <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
        <h2>Try React</h2>
        <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.
        </p>
        <h2>Learn React</h2>
        <p>People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful
          If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our practical tutorial.
          If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our guide to main concepts.
          Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it.
        </p>
        <h2>Staying Informed</h2>
        <p>The React blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted there first.
          You can also follow the @reactjs account on Twitter, but you won’t miss anything essential if you only read the blog.
          Not every React release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release in the CHANGELOG.md file in the React repository, as well as on the Releases page.
        </p>
        <h2>Versioned Documentation</h2>
        <p>This documentation always reflects the latest stable version of React. Since React 16, you can find older versions of the documentation on a separate page. Note that documentation for past versions is snapshotted at the time of the release, and isn’t being continuously updated.

        <p>Use as little or as much React as you need.
          React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Perhaps you only want to add some “sprinkles of interactivity” to an existing page. React components are a great way to do that.
          The majority of websites aren’t, and don’t need to be, single-page apps. With a few lines of code and no build tooling, try React in a small part of your website. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.
          </p>
          <h2>Add React in One Minute</h2>
          <p>In this section, we will show how to add a React component to an existing HTML page. You can follow along with your own website, or create an empty HTML file to practice.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 1: Add a DOM Container to the HTML</h3>
          <p>First, open the HTML page you want to edit. Add an empty <div> tag to mark the spot where you want to display something with React. For example:
          </p>
          <code><!-- ... existing HTML ... -->

            <div id="like_button_container"></div>
            
            <!-- ... existing HTML ... -->
          </code>
          <p>We gave this <div> a unique id HTML attribute. This will allow us to find it from the JavaScript code later and display a React component inside of it.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 2: Add the Script Tags</h3>
          <p>Next, add three script tags to the HTML page right before the closing /body tag:</p>
          <code>  <!-- ... other HTML ... -->

            <!-- Load React. -->
            <!-- Note: when deploying, replace "development.js" with "production.min.js". -->
            <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
            <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
          
            <!-- Load our React component. -->
            <script src="like_button.js"></script>
          
          </body></code>
          <p>The first two tags load React. The third one will load your component code.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 3: Create a React Component</h3>
          <p>Create a file called like_button.js next to your HTML page.
            After the starter code, add three lines to the bottom of like_button.js:
          </p>
          <code>// ... the starter code you pasted ...
            const domContainer = document.querySelector('#like_button_container');
            const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(domContainer);
            root.render(e(LikeButton));
          </code>
          <p> These three lines of code find the <div> we added to our HTML in the first step, create a React app with it, and then display our “Like” button React component inside of it.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
        <header>Hello World</header>
        <p>The smallest React example looks like this:</p>
        <code>const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
          root.render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>);
        </code>
        <p>It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page.</p>
      </section>
