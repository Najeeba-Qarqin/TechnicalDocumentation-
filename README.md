<h3>Step 1: Add a DOM Container to the HTML</h3>
          <p>First, open the HTML page you want to edit. Add an empty div tag to mark the spot where you want to display something with React. For example:
          </p>
          <div>
          <code>
            !-- ... existing HTML ... --

            div id="like_button_container"  div
            
            !-- ... existing HTML ... --
          </code>
        </div>
```

@media (max-width: 992px) {
  nav {
